## Features

### **AI-Powered Phone Detection**

* Real-time phone detection using computer vision
* Smart thresholding for reliable results
* Keras model trained using Teachable Machine

### **Focus Timer**

* Clean, distraction-free interface
* Visual countdown display
* Session completion tracking

### **Analytics Dashboard**

* Average phone confidence metrics
* High confidence detection count
* Real-time statistics display
* Performance tracking over time
* Visualizations via bar graphs, line charts, and more to better understand your focus behavior

### **To-Do List Page**

* Add, delete, and mark tasks as complete
* One-click cleanup of completed tasks
* Perfect for staying focused with a clear goal in mind

## Tech Stack

* **Frontend**: Streamlit
* **Backend**: Python
* **Computer Vision**: OpenCV, Keras model (Teachable Machine)
* **Deployment**: Local Server

## Prerequisites

Before running the application, ensure you have:

* **Python 3.10** *(older versions will not work; newer versions may cause compatibility issues)*
* **Virtual Environment** *(highly recommended)*
* **TensorFlow 2.13.0**
* **Keras 2.13.1** *(to match TensorFlow versioning)*
* **OpenCV, Streamlit, NumPy, etc.** *(full list in requirements.txt)*
* Webcam/Camera access
* Modern web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Safari)
* Internet connection for model downloads

## Setup Guide

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/FocusAI.git
   cd FocusAI
   ```

2. Create and activate a virtual environment:

   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   # On Windows
   venv\Scripts\activate
   # On Mac/Linux
   source venv/bin/activate
   ```

3. Install required packages:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. Start the app:

   ```bash
   streamlit run timer.py
   ```

## How It Works

1. The app accesses your webcam feed and the model analyzes each frame for phone presence
2. Each detection gets a confidence score (0.0 - 1.0)
3. App tracks when phones are detected during focus sessions by using a combination of average phone class' confidence and the number of times the phone class' confidence > 0.7
4. Real-time analytics show your focus patterns like total focus time over the week and how many times your phone has been detected, there is a separated page dedicated to show your stats
5. A "Falsely Detected?" button is included whenever the AI stops your timer. This gives the user a chance to continue their session in case the model made a mistake. This button is only active for 5 seconds after your timer has been stopped.
6. To Do lists in which you can add tasks, delete tasks, check them off, and clean up all the completed tasksâ€”with just one click. Also in a separated page you can access and start using

## Key Metrics

* **Average Phone Confidence**: Mean confidence score of all detections
* **High Confidence Count**: Number of detections above threshold (>0.7)
* **Focus Time**: Total time spent in focus mode
* **Interruption Rate**: Frequency of phone-related distractions

## Customization

### Modify Thresholds

```python
# In app.py
high_conf_count = sum(conf > 0.7 for conf in st.session_state.recent_confidences)  # Adjust between 0.0 - 1.0, line 729
if avg_conf > 0.7 and high_conf_count >= 2: # also adjustable, line 748
```

### Want to Use a Different Model?

Replace the `.h5` model file with your own exported model trained using Teachable Machine or any Keras-compatible tool. Just ensure the input shape and class indexing match.

## Troubleshooting

* **ModuleNotFoundError**: Make sure you're inside the virtual environment before installing or running the app
* **TensorFlow Import Issues**: Confirm youâ€™re using Python 3.10 with TensorFlow 2.13.0 and matching Keras version
* **Camera Access Issues**: Ensure your browser/OS grants permission to access the webcam
